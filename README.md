## Description
Pack'd is a webapp designed to help absent-minded vacationers get organized! Search by location to return item results pertaining to the destinations. Curate your results by their popularity, destination, season, type of travel, activities, and more!

Create & add your own items, then submit them to the community for up/down-voting, while you vote on other community items based on their own merits.

## Reflection
Design:
1. The design team created over 10 cohesive prototype pages with a mobile-first approach.
2. The final products are extremely similar to the wireframes.

Techicals: 
1. AJAX http requests were used to allow users to make changes to their trips without worrying about saving it as seen in the voting and checkbox elements. 
2. We also utilized the Google Maps API and The Visual Weather API to create a better user experience. 

Conclusion:
We were able to achieve both our design and technical goals that we initally laid out for ourselves.
